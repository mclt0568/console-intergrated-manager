#### FOR DEVELOPERS

C# written for linux and similar operating systems.  
Not sure if I ever want to make it into cross-platform yet.  
Entey point: `Program.Main()` of `./src/Program.cs`.  
You can build with the dotnet command line tools or use a preferred complier.  
  
This projects follows a loose coding convention, mostly based on the [C# at Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html)  
not because of anything, simply I like it better then the official Microsoft one.  
The convention is not forced.
